# Foreword

I'm starting to write this book alone and see where it goes,
but it should probably be a collaborative effort at some point.
It is intended as a bit of documentation around RustFest and give
new organisers some feel for it, but mostly also to ensure that
things don't get lost.

It's paradox that the rise of widely distributed
projects - especially FOSS projects - has given rise to many more on-site
meetings. Meetups, conferences and barcamps and gatherings act as focal
points during the year where projects are presented, discussed and started.

I firmly believe - against popular opinion - that running a conference
isn't a selfless act. In contrast, I believe that good conferences and
events work by putting your own flair into it. It's good to be inspired
and copy things that work, but you should always be aware that it's always
okay to just do stuff you like. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
People are kind, they will remember the good stuff.

Who you put on stage, how you prepare the stage,
how you construct the surroundings, how you solve problems and issues
is shaping communities. But that doesn't mean you can shape them in any
way you'd like. You need to listen, find drifts, dig for nuggets to
keep people engaged. And then there's the randomness: some superstar
delivers a very bad talk, but someone unknown presents something
mindblowing that shapes the community for years to come.

That being said, don't trust this book. Check everything and see if
it fits your puzzle. Please also note that this book makes no attempt
at documenting anything else but RustFest, so it's very specific. It's
intended as documentation for organisers that come after us, so that
history becomes a little less oral.

# Some thank yous

First and foremost RustFest wouldn't happen without an awesome group
of people. The RustFest team is a special kind of people, both chaotic,
but also very organised sometime.

RustFest wouldn't also ever happened without eurucamp. eurucamp
was a Ruby conference which I helped organise and a lot of things
we now just do were tried out there. Beyond thanking everyone
from the eurucamp teams and especially the eurucamp 2015 team,
I have to thank two people specifically:

Alex, who invented eurucamp and took me on as a co-organiser in 2012.
It's been a tough 3 years, but I learned a lot from you.
Especially the way of being uncompromising on seeing that attendees
as a group of individuals that just happened to be big, and the
way of steering the conference towards something that others _weren't_.
You wanted a conference by the lake. You got yourself a conference by
the lake. I heard you're more into islands now.

Dajana, who organised the Rails Girls workshop on eurucamp 2012. Dajana
joined the core team in 2013 officially and then moved on to do conference
organisation professionally. You've tought me the importance of keeping
people from slacking around and how to clear a lot of situations by
not ducking away. Organisation is stressful, but you made it very clear
that the worst is the stress we put on ourselves.
