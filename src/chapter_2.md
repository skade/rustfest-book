# What RustFest is

RustFest is the european Rust Conference. It adopts
many ideas from other conferences and then has a couple
of its own. Every RustFest is unique and the formula should
definitely be changed by the local team.

RustFest was started in 2016 by the Berlin Rust community,
wishing to have a local conference.

## The moving conference

RustFest moves. This is an aspect taken from [EuRuKo](https://euruko.org), which
started moving around Europe in 2007. Every edition is run in a different city,
preferably in a different country. This way, every community gets the chance to
present themselves at some point, without having to set up a full conference.

In contrast to EuRuKo, that doesn't happen by popular vote. That's mainly because
that's impractical giving the timing of RustFest.

## High Frequency

RustFest has a relatively high frequency for a community conference: it happens every
half year. This allows to quickly iterate and also have people meet regularly.


## Not all talk

RustFest was conceived in a time when many people were extremely new to Rust and
the community had to form. For that reason, we have decided to only have one
day of talk and one day for workshops and free-form meeting. Indeed, RustFest has
often been the starting point of projects and collaborations.


## Legal structure

RustFest financials is _currently_ owned by asquera event,
but that is mainly for practical reasons.
